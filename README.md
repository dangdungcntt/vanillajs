## Structured code with vanilla javascript?

I want to show how easy it is to develop a complex frontend application with just Vanilla JS. The biggest complaint I hear with Vanilla Javascript is lack of structure and it quickly becomes a mess. I don't think so and I have created these examples to show you how clean it can be..

This is a three step guide for Vanilla Javascript programming. 

* [First guide is the static webpage.](https://github.com/olavgg/vanillajs/wiki/The-static-website-vanilla-javascript)

* [Second guide is managing state with dynamic content.](https://github.com/olavgg/vanillajs/wiki/Add-dynamic-content-and-manage-state-with-vanilla-Javascript)

* [Third guide is solving DOM performance issues.](https://github.com/olavgg/vanillajs/wiki/Performance)
